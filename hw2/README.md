# DES
Implementation of DES encryption/decryption

## Input
 i. 10 lines of ordered pairs of key and plaintext (one pair per line) from the file “DES-Key-Plaintext.txt”.

ii. 10 lines of ordered pairs of key and ciphertext (one pair per line) from the file “DES-Key-Ciphertext.txt”. 

## Output

  i. 10 lines of ciphertext for the ordered pairs of key and plaintext (one pair per line) from the file “DES-Key-Plaintext.txt”.

 ii. 10 lines of plaintext for the ordered pairs of key and ciphertext (one pair per line) from the file “DES-Key-Ciphertext.txt”. 

iii. One line of time (in milliseconds) for the running time of each DES encryption ,twenty numbers seperated by space.
